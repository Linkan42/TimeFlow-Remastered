#   Checkout code:
#       Uses the actions/checkout action to clone your code repository
#       into the runner's workspace, making your code available for
#       subsequent steps.
#  
#   Set up Node.js:
#       Uses the actions/setup-node action to configure the Node.js
#       runtime environment with the specified Node.js version.
#  
#   Install dependencies:
#       Runs the npm install command to install project dependencies
#       defined in your package.json file.
#  
#   Transpile JSX to JS with Babel:
#       Executes the npm run build command, which initiates your
#       project's build process, including transpiling JSX to JavaScript
#       using Babel and any other necessary build tasks.
#  
#   Run ESLint:
#       Executes the npm run lint command, which typically runs ESLint
#       to perform code linting and identify code style issues in your
#       JavaScript/JSX code.
#
# These steps collectively check out your code, set up the Node.js
# environment, install dependencies, run code linting with ESLint,
# and perform code transpilation, depending on your
# project's build and testing configuration.
